				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>Western New York is bracing for a historic snowstorm that could dump 4 to 6 feet of snow on the region through Sunday, including &quot;thundersnow,&quot; according to forecasters.</p><p>Gov. Kathy Hochul and other state and local officials held a press conference in Buffalo on Thursday morning to urge New Yorkers to stay home until 7 p.m. Friday, when dangerous whiteout conditions are expected in an 11-county region stretching from Lake Erie&apos;s shores to Watertown, north of Syracuse.</p><p>&quot;We&apos;re talking about a massive, massive storm.&quot; This is classified as an extreme event, specifically an extreme weather event. That means it&apos;s dangerous, and it&apos;s also potentially fatal,&quot; the Democrat warned.</p><p>Hochul declared a state of emergency on Wednesday, allowing the government to send state resources to the region and activate the National Guard for rescue and recovery missions.</p><p>Authorities stated that they had nearly 600 plows, 5,700 utility trucks, and 42,000 tons of salt on standby. Beginning at 4 p.m., a 130-mile section of the New York State Thruway, as well as secondary highways in the area, were closed to traffic.</p><p>Wind gusts of up to 40 miles per hour and snowfall of up to 4 inches per hour were expected to make driving nearly impossible, according to officials.</p><p>&quot;When the snow is falling at that rate, it&apos;s almost impossible to clear the road to make it safe to travel, so you have to let it accumulate,&quot; Hochul warned.</p><p>Forecasters warned that the weather could bring &quot;thundersnow,&quot; or a thunderstorm that accumulates snow instead of rain.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>According to meteorologists, the thundersnow phenomenon typically occurs early in the season when relatively warmer air rising from the surface of Lake Erie, which is still about 52 degrees, collides with colder air in storm clouds, generating a charge that results in thunder and lightning.</p><p>&quot;When that happens, you get a lot of converging air at the surface and a lot of rising air in very narrow bands, which causes very localized amounts of snow to just dump out,&quot; Fox Weather meteorologist Geoff Bansen told The Washington Post.</p><p>&quot;With events of this magnitude, you don&apos;t typically see a lot of light snow; most of the snow is moderate to heavy, and it&apos;s just a matter of where those moderate bands set up,&quot; he explained. &quot;It could be whiteout conditions at point A, and then five miles up the road, it could be nothing.&quot;</p><p>According to Jackie Bray, commissioner of New York State&apos;s Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services, many people are at risk of injury or death even in their own driveways.</p><p>&quot;The majority of deaths during winter weather events are due to exertion.&quot; &quot;Over 20 people died in this region in 2014 during that snowstorm, and the majority of those deaths were heart attacks caused by exertion,&quot; Bray said, referring to another monster storm that dumped up to 65 inches on parts of the region a week before Thanksgiving that year.</p><p>&quot;When you&apos;re ready to shovel, go slowly, dress warmly, and take extra breaks,&quot; she advised.</p><p>Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz added, &quot;If people go out in these conditions, they are putting their lives at risk, and they&apos;re putting the lives at risk of the other individuals who then have to go out and try to save them. Please, therefore, remain at home.</p><p></span><br /></div>
