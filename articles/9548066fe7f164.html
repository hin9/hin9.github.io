				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Thursday that she will step down as leader of the House Democrats after two decades of service, leaving a legacy as one of the most powerful and divisive figures in American politics.</p><p>Pelosi, the first and only female speaker, announced that she would remain in the House, allowing the next generation to lead the House Democrats, who will be in the minority next year despite a better-than-expected midterm election performance.</p><p>&quot;I will not run for Democratic leadership in the next Congress,&quot; Pelosi declared in the House chamber. &quot;For me, the time has come for a new generation to lead the Democratic caucus that I admire so much, and I&apos;m grateful that so many are ready and willing to take on this enormous responsibility.&quot;</p><p>Pelosi, 82, rose to the top of the Democratic caucus in the House in 2002 after leading many in her party in opposition to a resolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq. She then led Democrats as they rode the tides of public opinion, seeing their power swell to a 257-seat majority following the 2008 elections, then crash to a 188-seat minority, and then rise again.</p><p>Her political career was marked by an exceptional ability to understand and overcome political shifts, keeping her party&apos;s opposing factions united in passing major legislation. She won the Speaker&apos;s gavel twice, in 2006 and 2018, and lost it after the 2010 elections.</p><p>Recently, she has completed a string of accomplishments with one of the smallest party splits in history, including the passage of a $1.9 trillion pandemic aid package last year and a $750 billion health-care, energy, and climate-change bill in August.</p><p>Her legislative victories during the Biden administration cemented her reputation as one of Congress&apos; most successful party leaders. Pelosi was instrumental in the passage of the massive economic stimulus bill and the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which provides health care coverage to over 35 million Americans.</p><p>Republicans have relentlessly attacked the California liberal over the last 20 years, portraying her as the personification of a party for the coastal elite. &quot;We fired Nancy Pelosi,&quot; House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said on Fox News on Wednesday, after Republicans reclaimed control of the chamber.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>In recent years, the rage directed at her has grown dangerous. Pro-Trump rioters searched for her during the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, and last month, a male assailant attacked Paul Pelosi, the speaker&apos;s husband, with a hammer at the couple&apos;s home in San Francisco while she was in Washington.</p><p>Pelosi told CNN&apos;s Anderson Cooper earlier this month that the politically motivated attack would influence her decision to retire. Paul Pelosi was released from the hospital two weeks ago after undergoing surgery to repair a skull fracture as well as arm and hand injuries.</p><p>The House chamber erupted in applause after she thanked her colleagues for their well-wishes for Paul.</p><p>Pelosi&apos;s long tenure caused friction within her own party. She won the presidency after the 2018 elections by promising her own party that she would step down by 2022.</p><p>Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton, who previously attempted to unseat Pelosi, told CNN that it&apos;s time to start over.</p><p>&quot;She&apos;s a historic speaker who has accomplished incredible things, but I also believe there are a lot of Democrats who are ready for a new chapter,&quot; Moulton said.</p><p>However, some Democrats praised Pelosi and expressed their desire for her to continue as leader.</p><p></span><br /></div>
