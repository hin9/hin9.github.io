				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>Here&apos;s some unconventional financial advice: Consider paying off your federal student loans this year.</p><p>According to Robert Farrington, a student loan expert and founder of The College Investor, there are better uses for your money right now, and the increasingly uncertain fate of President Biden&apos;s student loan forgiveness plan doesn&apos;t change a thing.</p><p>&quot;Never give the government money that they do not have a legal right to. It is not advantageous to you &quot;Farrington stated this week during a NextAdvisor webinar about student loan forgiveness. &quot;There is no reason. Your interest is set to nil. Your monthly payment is currently set to zero. It&apos;s simply costing you money that you didn&apos;t have to spend every month.&quot;</p><p>Use this time to save for an emergency, pay off private student loans or other high-interest debt, invest, or save for other long-term goals such as home ownership. If you want to contribute to your student loans, put your monthly payment in a high-yield savings account and let it grow until the student loan payment pause ends, then make a lump-sum payment all at once.</p><p>&quot;You can use that money in other ways, such as saving for retirement or purchasing a home,&quot; he says. &quot;Or you could just return it to your loans.&quot;</p><p>Farrington&apos;s advice comes at an unusual time in the history of student loan borrowers. The president&apos;s student loan forgiveness plan is currently on hold due to several federal lawsuits, and it&apos;s unclear whether the plan will be able to move forward. Biden announced a plan in August to cancel up to $20,000 in federal student loan debt for 43 million borrowers. Borrowers will also be able to continue skipping monthly payments until December 31, according to Biden.</p><p>Because of the ongoing legal challenges to Biden&apos;s student loan relief plan, Farrington says he wouldn&apos;t be surprised if the student loan payment pause was extended for the eighth time.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>&quot;It appears that extending the pause may be on the table again,&quot; he says. &quot;However, borrowers should still be prepared to resume payments because, as we&apos;ve seen in previous extensions, the actual extension may not come until days before payments are due.&quot;</p><p>You don&apos;t want to be caught off guard as a borrower if payments resume in January. Sign up for student loan relief updates from the Department of Education, confirm your loan servicer via studentaid.gov and update your contact information, and review and make adjustments to your current budget. If you&apos;ve made any student loan payments since March 2020, request a refund from your loan servicer as soon as possible and put it in a high-yield savings account until the forgiveness plan is updated.</p><p>Even if student loan payments resume in early 2023, Farrington does not recommend working extra hard this year to erase your government loans.</p><p>&quot;There&apos;s so much uncertainty,&quot; Farrington says, &quot;that I wouldn&apos;t want the government holding onto my money.&quot; &quot;Instead, you could be saving or investing.&quot;</p><p>NextAdvisor is a firm believer in editorial independence and transparency.
