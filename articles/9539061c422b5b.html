				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>Washington House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the first woman to hold the position, announced Thursday that she will not seek another term as Democratic leader, bringing an end to her two decades as the party prepares to lose its majority to the Republicans.</p><p>Pelosi will remain in the House after winning a 19th term in last week&apos;s midterm elections, but will take on a lower-profile role when the next Congress convenes in January.</p><p>&quot;Now we must move boldly into the future, grounded in the principles that have propelled us this far while remaining open to new possibilities,&quot; Pelosi said. &quot;I will not run for Democratic leadership in the next Congress because I am confident in our caucus. The time has come, in my opinion, for a new generation to lead the Democratic caucus.&quot;</p><p>Pelosi began her speech by recounting her journey &quot;from homemaker to House speaker,&quot; from first seeing the U.S. Capitol as a 6-year-old to working alongside presidents of both parties. She paid homage to the Americans who served before her and extolled the historic legislative acts of the House, including the abolition of slavery and granting women the right to vote, calling the Capitol a &quot;temple of our democracy, of our Constitution, of our highest ideals.&quot; &quot;A new day is dawning on the horizon,&quot; she said, &quot;and I look forward, always forward, to the unfolding story of our nation.&quot; &quot;A story of light and love, patriotism and progress, many becoming one, and an unfinished mission to make today&apos;s dreams tomorrow&apos;s reality.&quot;</p><p>Pelosi finished her remarks to raucous applause from her Democratic colleagues, who embraced her as she walked away from the podium. According to the White House, President Biden spoke with Pelosi on Thursday morning and congratulated her on her tenure.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>In a statement, the president said, &quot;When I think of Nancy Pelosi, I think of dignity.&quot; &quot;She will be remembered as the most influential House of Representatives speaker in American history. There are numerous examples of how she embodies elected officials&apos; obligation to uphold their oath to God and country in order to ensure our democracy delivers and remains a beacon to the world. In everything she does, she reflects a dignity that she sees in the lives of the people of this country.&quot;</p><p>Pelosi&apos;s decision to allow a new generation of lawmakers to lead the caucus puts an end to months of speculation about her political future. It also comes after a violent attack on her husband, Paul Pelosi, at their San Francisco home last month, which the speaker told CNN would influence her decision. Pelosi was the suspected assailant&apos;s target, but she was in Washington at the time.</p><p>Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the current majority leader and Pelosi&apos;s longtime No. 2, has joined Pelosi in stepping down from Democratic leadership. In a letter to his colleagues, Hoyer stated that he would remain in Congress but would not seek leadership. His decision clears the way for Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the chair of the Democratic Caucus, to ascend to party leader when Democratic members vote in leadership elections at the end of the month. Hoyer endorsed Jeffries for Democratic leader, describing him as a &quot;skilled and capable leader.&quot;</p><p></span><br /></div>
