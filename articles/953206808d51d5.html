More on Pelosi&apos;s announcement can be found in the posts below, and you can also listen to the latest CNN Political Briefing podcast, which discusses the changing power dynamics in Congress.</p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Thursday that she will step down as House Democratic leader after two decades of service, leaving a legacy as one of the most powerful and divisive figures in American politics.</p><p>Pelosi&apos;s long tenure caused friction within her own party. She won the presidency following the 2018 elections by promising Democrats that she would step down by 2022.</p><p>House Democrats appear to be leaning toward New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, 52, to succeed Pelosi as leader, though Democrats will not vote until November 30.</p><p>Following her speech on Thursday, Pelosi refused to tell reporters who she would support. However, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn announced their resignations from leadership positions and endorsed Jeffries to succeed Pelosi.</p><p>According to Hoyer, Jeffries &quot;will make history for the House and for our country.&quot; Clyburn also expressed optimism that Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark and California Rep. Pete Aguilar would join Jeffries in the House Democratic leadership.</p><p>Prior to Pelosi&apos;s announcement, Ohio Rep. Joyce Beatty, chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, told CNN that she expects her caucus to rally behind Jeffries and help him become the House&apos;s first Black Democratic leader.</p><p>Former CBC chairman and retiring North Carolina Rep. G.K. Butterfield told CNN that Jeffries is &quot;prepared for the moment&quot; if Pelosi steps down. Butterfield predicted Jeffries would flee.</p><p>On Sunday&apos;s &quot;State of the Union,&quot; Pelosi told CNN&apos;s Dana Bash that members of her caucus had asked her to &quot;consider&quot; running in the party&apos;s leadership elections at the end of the month, adding, &quot;But, again, let&apos;s just get through the election.&quot;</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>&quot;Any decision to run again is about family, and also my colleagues,&quot; the longtime Democratic leader had said. And what we want to do is move forward in a very unified manner as we prepare for the upcoming Congress.&quot;</p><p>&quot;However, a lot is at stake because we&apos;ll be having a presidential election.&quot; So, once again, my decision will be based on the wishes of my family and my caucus,&quot; she explained. &quot;But none of it will be seriously considered until we see what the end result is.&quot; And there are numerous ways to wield power.&quot;</p><p>In a sign of the difficulties House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy still faces in obtaining the 218 votes needed to become speaker, two members of the far-right House Freedom Caucus told CNN that he does not have the necessary support.</p><p>Rep. Andy Biggs, who lost to McCarthy this week when the GOP conference nominated him to be the next speaker, predicted that after some negotiating, &quot;some kind of consensus candidate&quot; would emerge.</p><p>When asked about McCarthy&apos;s chances of becoming speaker, Biggs stated unequivocally, &quot;He doesn&apos;t have the votes.&quot;</p><p>When asked when he will formally announce his candidacy for Democratic leader, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries said now is the time to honor Nancy Pelosi&apos;s legacy as speaker.</p><p>&quot;Let&apos;s spend the rest of the day reflecting on Speaker Pelosi&apos;s historic role and the opportunity we&apos;ve all had to serve alongside her.&quot;</p><p></span><br /></div>
