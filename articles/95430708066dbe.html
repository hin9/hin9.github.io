				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced that she will not run for reelection to the Democratic Party&apos;s congressional leadership after Republicans regained control of the chamber by a slim margin.</p><p>Pelosi, 82, became the first female speaker of the House in 2007, and has been the top Democratic lawmaker for nearly 20 years. She stated on Thursday that she will continue to serve in Congress to represent her California constituents, but that she is ready to pass the leadership torch to the next generation.</p><p>Her decision comes less than a month after an intruder assaulted her husband at the couple&apos;s San Francisco home in a politically motivated attack, according to US authorities.</p><p>&quot;I will not seek reelection to Democratic leadership in the next Congress with great confidence in our caucus,&quot; Pelosi said in a speech on the House floor. &quot;For me, the time has come for a new generation to lead the Democratic caucus that I admire so much, and I&apos;m grateful that so many are ready and willing to take on this enormous responsibility.&quot;</p><p>At the end of the month, Democrats will choose their leaders for the new Congress, which will convene early next year. House Democratic Conference Chairman Hakeem Jeffries, 52, of New York, is widely regarded as the frontrunner to succeed Pelosi.</p><p>The top three Democrats in the House, Nancy Pelosi, Steny Hoyer, and Jim Clyburn, are all in their 80s.</p><p>Hoyer also announced in a letter to Democratic lawmakers on Thursday that he will not run for office in the next Congress, citing the need for a &quot;new generation of leaders.&quot; Clyburn has also indicated that he will step down as whip.</p><p>&quot;Speaker Pelosi has left an indelible mark on Congress and the country, and I look forward to her continued service and doing everything I can to help our new generation of Democratic Leaders, which I hope will be Hakeem Jeffries, Katherine Clark, and Pete Aguilar,&quot; Clyburn wrote in a tweet.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>Pelosi warned about the fate of US democracy in her speech on Tuesday, citing a January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol by supporters of former President Donald Trump who sought to prevent the certification of President Joe Biden&apos;s 2020 election victory.</p><p>Pelosi stated, &quot;American democracy is majestic, but it is fragile.&quot; &quot;Many of us here have witnessed this fragility tragically firsthand in this chamber. As a result, democracy must always be defended against those who wish it harm.&quot;</p><p>She expressed gratitude to her husband, who was attacked with a hammer last month, fueling fears of political violence. &quot;Thank you to my dear husband, Paul, who has been my beloved life partner and pillar of support: We&apos;re grateful for everyone&apos;s prayers and well-wishes as he recovers &quot;She spoke to a nearly full House, which responded with a standing ovation.</p><p>Biden referred to Pelosi as the &quot;most consequential&quot; House speaker in American history.</p><p>&quot;The lives of millions of Americans have improved as a result of Nancy Pelosi, even in districts represented by Republicans who voted against her bills and frequently vilify her. Nancy is always working for the dignity of all people &quot;On Thursday, the US president issued a statement.</p><p>The daughter of a former US congressman and Baltimore mayor, Pelosi has been serving in the House since 1987 before some current members of her caucus were born.</p><p></span><br /></div>
