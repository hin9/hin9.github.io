				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>Republican Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz attempted to derail a Senate vote to explicitly recognize same-sex marriages on Wednesday, but 12 Republicans joined Democrats to clear the way for the bill&apos;s passage.</p><p>The Respect for Marriage Act would repeal the Defense of Marriage Act of 1996, which prohibited the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriage until the United States Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional in 2013. In 2015, the Supreme Court went even further, ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges that states cannot prohibit same-sex marriages, declaring that gay, lesbian, and bisexual Americans have a constitutional right to marry.</p><p>The core provisions of the Respect for Marriage Act would only be relevant if the Supreme Court reversed that decision in the same way that it revoked a constitutional right to abortion this summer.</p><p>If Obergefell is overturned, the bill would not require states that currently have unenforceable bans on same-sex marriage, such as Texas, to provide marriage certificates to gay, lesbian, and bisexual couples. However, it would require the state to recognize a same-sex marriage that took place in a state where it is legal. The Senate vote on Wednesday clears the way for it to easily pass the chamber. It will then be sent back to the House for consideration of the Senate amendments. The original version of the bill was passed by the House in July.</p><p>Cruz blasted Republican Senators who voted with Democrats to give the bill the 60 votes it needed to avoid a filibuster in the Senate.</p><p>Cornyn told reporters on Tuesday that he would vote no because gay marriage is already a constitutional right.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>Cruz also claimed that the vote was hurting Republicans&apos; chances in Georgia&apos;s high-stakes Senate runoff between Democratic U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker. On Wednesday, Cruz said on his podcast that the bill was &quot;kicking evangelical voters in Georgia in the teeth.&quot;</p><p>Following the Supreme Court&apos;s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, Democrats made it a priority to codify same-sex marriage at the federal level, fearing that the court would reconsider constitutional protections for gay marriage. A concurring opinion from conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, who urged the court to reconsider cases involving same-sex marriage, was included in the U.S. Supreme Court&apos;s overturning of the constitutional protection for abortion. This fueled LGBTQ groups&apos; already-heightened fears that the end of Roe v. Wade was only the tip of the iceberg for the court&apos;s heavily conservative majority.</p><p>Democrats considered passing the marriage bill before the midterm elections, but decided against it. Republicans had voiced concerns about the need to protect religious liberties in the bill, but a group of bipartisan Senators announced this week they reached an agreement on a revised version of the legislation, which they think will garner enough Republican votes.</p><p>Religious leaders and the LGBTQ community have both criticized the bill. A number of religious leaders argue that the bill violates religious liberty, and some LGBTQ activists argue that it does not go far enough to protect same-sex marriage.</p><p></span><br /></div>
