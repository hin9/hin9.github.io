				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>When will Pokmon Scarlet and Violet be released? When do the games become available? Is it possible to obtain the game early? We can answer all of your questions, including some you didn&apos;t even realize you had, right here on Nintendo Life!</p><p>The two Pokmon games can be pre-ordered on the Switch eShop ahead of their release this week, either separately or as a double-pack, and are also available to pre-load so you can start playing right away.</p><p>Pokmon Scarlet and Violet will be available on November 18th. Because Nintendo does not announce release dates, the following are educated guesses based on previous first-party game unlocks:</p><p>You may have noticed that the times listed above exclude a large portion of the world, specifically Australia, New Zealand, and East Asia. Because the timing varies so much, we can&apos;t say for sure if those regions get access to the game even sooner. It&apos;s only a few hours, but it may feel like an eternity if your Pok Ball hand is twitching.</p><p>If you create an Australian account on your Switch, you may be able to download Pokmon Scarlet or Violet before the rest of the world. You can still play the game with your regular Switch user account, but the game will be tied to the account that is region-locked to Australia, so use an email account that you have access to!</p><p>You&apos;ll also need to pay in Australian currency, but don&apos;t worry about getting an overseas credit card; simply get some Australian eShop credit.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>Note. If you purchase and transfer your data to a new Nintendo Switch in the future, you will have to redownload the game from the Australian eShop using the Australian Nintendo Account you created. It will still be accessible, no problem, but keep in mind that you can download the game from any old region&apos;s eShop, not just the one where you made the initial purchase.</p><p>The game will require 7GB of storage space, plus an additional 1GB for a day-one update. If you buy the Double Pack, you&apos;ll get 14GB plus 2GB for updates.</p><p>We already have a comprehensive guide on this, but in summary, Scarlet is themed around the color red and the past, while Violet is themed around the color purple and the future. All version-exclusive Pokmon and other differences can be found here:</p><p>We&apos;re currently offering 10% off the digital editions of both games as part of our massive Black Friday sale. If you live in the United Kingdom or Europe, simply add your desired game(s) to your basket and use the code BLACKFRIDAY at checkout:</p><p>Unfortunately, we do not have the games available as codes for those of you in the United States. You can, however, save money by taking 10% off the required eShop credit. The games are $59.99 each, so simply add $60 in credit to your cart, use code BLACKFRIDAY to get 10% off, and you&apos;ll be able to buy the game with a $5 credit left over!</p><p></span><br /></div>
