				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>The Senate broke a filibuster on Wednesday, paving the way for the historic passage of a bipartisan bill to protect same-sex and interracial marriage.</p><p>There may be additional votes before final passage, but Wednesday&apos;s successful test vote indicates the bill is on track to pass, a remarkable turnaround given how contentious same-sex marriage was just a few years ago.</p><p>While the bill would not impose a national requirement that all states legalize same-sex marriage, it would require individual states to recognize the legal marriage of another state. In the event that the Supreme Court overturns its 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges decision, which legalized same-sex marriage, a state may still pass legislation prohibiting same-sex marriage, but that state must recognize a same-sex marriage from another state.</p><p>All 50 members of the Democratic caucus, as well as 12 Republicans, voted to begin debate on the bill.</p><p>When the chamber will vote on final passage is unknown. Without an agreement to expedite passage of the bill, which requires the approval of all 100 senators, final passage will most likely take place after the Senate returns from its Thanksgiving recess.</p><p>Despite this, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told CNN that he wants his chamber&apos;s bill to pass before senators leave for their Thanksgiving break next week.</p><p>&quot;We&apos;re hoping for that,&quot; he said.</p><p>Earlier this week, Schumer expressed &quot;hope&quot; that &quot;both sides can work quickly together to move this bill through the Senate and on to the president&apos;s desk&quot; following the vote on Wednesday.</p><p>&quot;It already passed the House with significant 47 Republican votes earlier this year, and I&apos;m optimistic we can achieve a significant result in this chamber,&quot; he added.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>After passing the Senate, the bill must be reintroduced in the House before being signed into law by President Joe Biden. Supporters of the bill hope to get it through the House before the end of the year, with Republicans on track to take control of the chamber in the next Congress.</p><p>Earlier this week, the bipartisan negotiators who worked on the legislation stated that they were &quot;confident&quot; the bill had enough votes to pass and hoped it could be put to a vote on the floor.</p><p>In a statement issued Monday, the bipartisan group, which includes Republican Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio, Susan Collins of Maine, and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, as well as Democratic Sens. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, said they &quot;look forward to this legislation coming to the floor.&quot;</p><p>Lawmakers had hoped to pass the bill before leaving for the midterm elections, but the chamber delayed a vote until after the November elections after negotiators requested more time to secure support. Given the bill&apos;s supporters&apos; 12 Republican votes to break the filibuster on Wednesday, that gamble appears to have paid off.</p><p>In a sign of how much support for same-sex marriage has grown in recent years, the bill received support from Republican senators, including those from deeply red states.</p><p>Wyoming Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis told CNN&apos;s Manu Raju that she voted to advance the Senate&apos;s same-sex marriage bill because of &quot;Article 1, Section 3 of the Wyoming Constitution,&quot; which includes an anti-discrimination clause.</p><p>&quot;That&apos;s why we&apos;re known as the equality state,&quot; she continued.</p><p></span><br /></div>
