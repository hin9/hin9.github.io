				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>Subaru unveiled the new sixth-generation Impreza today at the Los Angeles Auto Show. The sedan variant and manual gearbox option are being phased out for the 2024 model year, but the 2.5 RS model is being brought back for the first time since 2005.</p><p>The new car, as expected, has a lot in common with its stablemate, the Crosstrek. With its hexagonal grille, trim bar connecting the headlights, and silhouette, the new front fascia and overall design are reminiscent of the crossover.</p><p>The new Impreza will be 10% stiffer than the model it replaces and will have an improved, symmetrical all-wheel-drive system. Meanwhile, Subaru has returned to the four-cylinder boxer engine under the hood.</p><p>Read: New Subaru Crosstrek Debuts With Evolved Design And Technology Built On The Same Foundation</p><p>However, for 2024, it will be available in two displacements. The 2.5-liter boxer engine, which brings back the RS nameplate, will be the most exciting. Subaru has revealed that the new model will produce 182 hp (136 kW/185 PS) and 178 lb-ft (241 Nm) of torque when it returns to America for the first time since 2005.</p><p>The Impreza RS is the most powerful model in the lineup, with a sport-tuned suspension, larger brakes, special 18-inch dark gray alloy wheels, black trim pieces, aluminum pedals, upgraded LED headlights, black cloth seats, and a luxurious 10-speaker Harman Kardon audio system.</p><p>For those looking for performance at a lower price point, the 2024 Subaru Impreza Sport will match the sport tuned suspension, the bigger brakes, and the 18-inch alloy wheels with the standard 2.0-liter engine, which makes 152 hp (113 kW/154 PS) and 145 lb-ft (197 Nm) of torque. It will also have blind spot detection, rear cross traffic alert, keyless entry, remote start, and performance and fuel-efficient driving modes.</p><p>Meanwhile, Subaru&apos;s Eyesight driver assistance features and automatic emergency braking will be standard on the base Impreza in 2024. The vehicle will also have integrated roof rack mounting points to help owners haul more.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>Regardless of engine, the Impreza will come with only one transmission, Subaru&apos;s Lineartronic CVT, as the Japanese manufacturer has dropped the five-speed manual box. However, the Sport and RS models will have a special &quot;manual&quot; mode with eight selectable &quot;gears&quot; to help drivers feel more in control.</p><p>All models receive the dual-pinion electronic power steering rack from the fifth-generation WRX. According to Subaru, it provides a more direct and natural steering feel as well as increased responsiveness.</p><p>Subaru promises new, more supportive seats and more in-cabin storage. Meanwhile, the rear seats will fold down into a 60/40 split for flexibility. The climate control system is also smarter now, warming or cooling only the seats that are occupied for better fuel economy and comfort.</p><p>The 11.6-inch infotainment system is installed in portrait mode and includes wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto as standard on the RS and Sport models.</p><p>Finally, Subaru wants to maintain the Impreza&apos;s reputation for safety, so Starlink Safety and Security Connected Services will be available. This package includes emergency assistance, roadside assistance, a monthly vehicle health report, security alarm notifications, automatic emergency braking, and other features.</p><p>Subaru expects the new sixth-generation Impreza to hit dealerships in the spring of 2023. Pricing will be revealed closer to the event.</p><p></span><br /></div>
