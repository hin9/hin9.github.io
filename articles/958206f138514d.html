Amy Schneider, one of the contestants, responded, &quot;Who are the Hebrews?&quot; while Sam Buttrey, another contestant, responded, &quot;Who are the Romans?&quot;</p><p>Schneider&apos;s answer was deemed correct while Buttrey&apos;s was deemed incorrect, resulting in Buttrey&apos;s inability to win the evening.</p><p>CONNECTED: &apos;The Chosen&apos; Star Jonathan Roumie does not feel obligated to play the role of Jesus, but cites prayer and scripture as essential to playing the role authentically.</p><p>However, because the text does not reveal who wrote the letter to the Hebrews, New Testament scholars have long debated who wrote it. While the theory that the letter was written by the apostle Paul is perhaps the most popular, it is far from universally accepted in academic circles.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>This means that most biblical scholars would argue that Buttrey&apos;s answer was correct, which has sparked outrage among fans, viewers, and Christian exegetes who believe Buttrey was denied victory.</p><p>One viewer tweeted, &quot;Wow, honestly STUNNED by the poorly researched Final @Jeopardy question today.&quot; &quot;The correct answer was allegedly Hebrews, despite the fact that Paul&apos;s authorship of Hebrews is HIGHLY contested at best. And all throughout the Tournament of Champions!! It completely alters the outcome. I&apos;m so disappointed.&quot;</p><p>Others used the occasion to express their support for Priscilla, the apostle Paul&apos;s missionary partner and Aquila&apos;s wife, according to a minority view that has gained traction in recent years.</p><p>Dru Johnson, a Bible professor, tweeted an image of the clue with annotations. He wrote &quot;Nope&quot; around Paul&apos;s name. &quot;Not really,&quot; he said, circling the term epistle. Circling &quot;Old Testament,&quot; he corrected, &quot;LXX,&quot; which is an abbreviation for the Septuagint, a Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible from which the author of Hebrews quoted. Finally, circling &quot;quotations,&quot; he wrote, &quot;Depends on what you count as quotation,&quot; emphasizing that the letter contains both direct quotes and paraphrases of Hebrew Bible statements.</p><p></span><br /></div>
