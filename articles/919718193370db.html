				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>In the cool fog of Wednesday morning, a bus carrying 28 immigrants from Texas arrived outside Philadelphia&apos;s 30th Street Station. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott dispatched the bus in an effort to bring border challenges to northern cities, according to Abbott.</p><p>According to immigration advocates in Philadelphia, the bus ride was a cruel trick played on innocent people who are legally present in the United States. Philadelphia</p><p>Abbott&apos;s administration was labeled &quot;cruel and racist&quot; by Mayor Jim Kenney for sending the bus to the city with little notice and no plan to assist the families once they arrived. &quot;It is sad and outrageous that Governor Abbott and his administration continue to implement cruel and racist policies that use immigrant families, including children, as pawns to shamelessly push their warped political agenda,&quot; he said.</p><p>Immigrants, mostly from Colombia, but also from the Dominican Republic and Cuba, began disembarking around 6:15 a.m. in Philadelphia, according to an advocate. Volunteers provided the families with winter coats, blankets, and hot chocolate. Helen Gym, a member of the City Council, greeted a woman with a baby with a hug and words of welcome. The group that traveled from Texas included at least two infants. Gym stated, &quot;Seeking asylum is a human right.&quot; &quot;Our country has always welcomed people seeking refuge here, and as a result, we have thrived. When we embrace and welcome people looking for a better life, we strengthen our city and country.&quot;</p><p>Dobin Garmendia, 23, emigrated from Nicaragua to the United States. He stated in Spanish that people he believed to be Texas officials offered to transport him and others to Philadelphia for free if they did not have the necessary funds. He described the bus ride as generally uneventful.</p><p>&quot;I need to find work and report to immigration,&quot; he said of his plans for the next few days.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>The bus had left 30th Street by 6:25 a.m., leaving 19 people to board a Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority bus to a welcome center set up by the city in North Philadelphia. One of the children was being treated at a nearby hospital for a high fever.</p><p>According to Pennsylvania state Rep. Amen Brown, who met with the families in North Philly, only one person will remain in the city. &quot;The mood is good,&quot; he said of the newcomers. &quot;They&apos;re looking forward to seeing family members. Philadelphia stepped up.&quot;</p><p>Georgina, who was picked up from the welcome center by family before she could give her last name, described being on the bus for about two days and being given a small packaged meal. The 24-year-old said she felt &quot;super good&quot; and was excited to see her family in Philadelphia.</p><p>According to Emilio Buitrago, founder of Casa De Venezuela, everyone who is still at the welcome center is being screened and fed. &quot;It&apos;s not the Four Seasons,&quot; he admitted. &quot;They have a rest room, a small TV, a microwave, and their basic needs are being met right now.&quot;</p><p>City officials and immigrant-assistance groups have been readying for days to meet the bus, carrying people originally from Central and South America.</p><p></span><br /></div>
