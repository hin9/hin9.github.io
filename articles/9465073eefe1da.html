				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>There&apos;s a good chance you or a loved one are concerned about federal student loans right now.</p><p>Will there be forgiveness? Will student loan payments begin as planned in January?</p><p>It&apos;s no secret that education is costly.</p><p>In fact, $29,719 was the average amount borrowed by college graduates who took out loans last year.</p><p>President Joe Biden recently issued an executive order to cancel some of that debt.</p><p>Under his plan, most Americans earning less than $125,000 per year would have $10,000 forgiven.</p><p>Pell Grant recipients could have up to $20,000 forgiven.</p><p>However, Biden&apos;s actual debt cancellation has not gone as smoothly as he would have liked.</p><p>In fact, the entire program is currently on hold, raising concerns among millions of Americans.</p><p>First and foremost, you should be aware that six states have filed a lawsuit to prevent forgiveness: Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and South Carolina.</p><p>In court documents, leaders in those states argue that the president is incapable of doing so.</p><p>So far, they&apos;ve persuaded the courts that they&apos;re correct.</p><p>Missouri, for example, has argued that if forgiveness occurs, the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority, which services many federal loans, will lose money, affecting state tax revenues indirectly.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>According to the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals, forgiveness &quot;presents a threatened financial harm to the State of Missouri.&quot;</p><p>Due to the current ruling of the 8th Circuit, as well as separate legal challenges, if you go to Studentaid.gov right now, you will receive an urgent message informing you that you cannot apply for any forgiveness.</p><p>In terms of what happens next, the Biden administration has filed an appeal with the United States Supreme Court.</p><p>White House lawyers will argue that Biden has the legal authority to grant forgiveness.</p><p>Lawyers are first attempting to have an injunction lifted. They will almost certainly argue soon for the case to be heard entirely by the Supreme Court.</p><p>Needless to say, all of this will take time, possibly months, putting an increased emphasis on the calendar.</p><p>Keep in mind that federal student loan payments will resume on January 1st for the first time since March 2020.</p><p>Biden stated that there would be no further extensions.</p><p>However, that has become less certain in recent days, with the possibility that payments will be delayed again while the legal debate continues.</p><p>A number of student advocacy groups are actively lobbying for another postponement.</p><p>For the time being, federal student loan payments and forgiveness remain in limbo. According to congressional estimates, debt cancellation would cost taxpayers around $400 billion.</p><p></span><br /></div>
