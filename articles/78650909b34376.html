				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>You may have heard that the church came out in support of the Respect for Marriage Act yesterday. This support is significant, in my opinion, for reasons I&apos;ll explain shortly.</p><p>However, before we get into why this is such a big deal, it&apos;s probably worth looking into what and why the Respect for Marriage Act is.</p><p>The Respect for Marriage Act, in broad strokes, is a replacement for the Defense of Marriage Act of the 1990s. (I mean that literally: Section 3 of RfMA repeals a federal law provision added by DOMA that expressly allows states and the federal government to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages enacted in other states.)</p><p>The RfMA does the opposite: under the RfMA, states must give full faith and credit to marriages performed in other states and cannot deny marriage benefits based on the married persons&apos; &quot;sex, race, ethnicity, or national origin.&quot;</p><p>But, you may wonder, why would something like RfMA be required? Didn&apos;t the Supreme Court rule that same-sex marriage bans are unconstitutional? Yes, indeed. It did. However, the Supreme Court&apos;s recent Dobbs decision called into question whether it will follow its precedent and continue to recognize rights based on the Fourteenth Amendment. True, Justice Alito dismisses as &quot;unfounded&quot; concerns that Dobbs will result in the overturning of Obergefell and Lawrence. However, Alito&apos;s assurances ring hollow in light of the opinion&apos;s substance and Justice Thomas&apos; concurrence, in which he urges the Court to reconsider all of its substantive due process decisions, including Lawrence and Obergefell. While the bill is no longer relevant, it does provide significant protection to same-sex married couples if the Court maintains its skepticism of substantive due process.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>I&apos;ll mention here that I&apos;ve seen some Twitter criticism of RfMA, claiming that it doesn&apos;t go far enough. While it requires states to recognize same-sex marriages, it does not require them to perform same-sex marriages; in the absence of constitutional protection for same-sex marriage, states could prohibit same-sex marriage. LGBTQ couples who lived in one of those states would have to cross state lines to marry, which would be a significant burden. These critics would like the federal government to make same-sex marriage legal.</p><p>So, why isn&apos;t it doing that? Because it lacks the necessary constitutional authority. Because I&apos;m not a con law expert, I contacted a friend and colleague who is, and he explained why my intuition was correct. He basically explained that the 14th Amendment&apos;s enforcement clause powers are limited. If the Supreme Court overturns Obergefell, the federal government will lack the authority to compel states to issue marriage licenses because there will be no underlying constitutional violation to address.</p><p>As a result, the best Congress can do is require states to recognize marriages in other states. It&apos;s not a perfect solution, but it provides important protections to married couples in the event Obergefell is repealed.</p><p>So, what&apos;s the big deal about the LDS Church&apos;s support? There are at least three reasons. The first is that, as far as I know, this is the first time the church has recognized the civil legitimacy of same-sex marriage. Previously, the church acknowledged some fundamental individual dignity of LGBTQ people while making a normative argument against same-sex marriage. It acknowledges the legitimacy of such marriages and publicly supports legislation requiring civil recognition.</p><p></span><br /></div>
