				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>Texas Gov. Greg Abbott wrote to Joe Biden on Wednesday, urging him to fulfill his constitutional obligations to protect the country from what Abbott called a &quot;invasion&quot; of migrants at the southern border.</p><p>Abbott blasted the president&apos;s policies, saying Biden&apos;s &quot;inaction has resulted in catastrophic consequences&quot; for Texas communities. The governor, a major Republican critic of Biden&apos;s, has become increasingly focused on immigration, drawing criticism from migrants&apos; advocates and the Biden administration.</p><p>&quot;In order to fulfill your constitutional duty to enforce federal immigration laws and protect the states from invasion,&quot; Abbott wrote, &quot;you must reinstate the policies that you eliminated, or craft and implement new policies.&quot;</p><p>His letter reflects his push to increase his rhetoric about the Biden administration&apos;s &quot;open-border policies.&quot;</p><p>Abott tweeted on Tuesday that he had &quot;invoked the Invasion Clauses of the United States and Texas Constitutions to fully authorize Texas to take unprecedented measures to defend our state against an invasion.&quot;</p><p>The governor included a list of actions in the tweet that he claimed he had constitutional authority to take, including deploying gun boats to parts of the border, deploying Department of Public Safety officers to arrest illegal immigrants, and constructing portions of the border wall.</p><p>That announcement sparked a flurry of false headlines claiming that Abbott had declared a &quot;invasion&quot; at the southern border, giving him increased authority to activate local state law enforcement agencies to deport migrants.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>During her testimony before the state Senate Committee on Border Security on Tuesday, Abbott&apos;s budget director, Sarah Hicks, was asked about the tweet, and she reassured the panel of Texas legislators that the governor was not announcing a new strategy, but rather reiterating some of the actions he has already taken to stem illegal immigration.</p><p>&quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a shift in overall strategy as much as it is a reminder to all of us, to Congress, and to the members working on the issue, that this is a serious issue that requires a full and serious response,&quot; Hicks said.</p><p>Abbott has issued a series of executive orders aimed at reducing immigration since Biden took office last year. In July, he gave state law enforcement the authority to return migrants suspected of illegally entering the country to ports of entry. Immigration advocates and human rights organizations have criticized the move, claiming that it endangers migrants and exposes people who are lawfully seeking asylum to racial profiling.</p><p>On Wednesday, the governor again urged the Texas Department of Public Safety and the Texas Military Department to &quot;expand their unprecedented efforts to combat the growing illegal immigration along the Texas-Mexico border.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You have an essential assignment: Use every available tool and strategy to fight back against the unprecedented invasion that Texas is seeing at our border. Texas Guardsmen and Troopers must bear the burden of border security until Congress acts or the Biden Administration does its constitutionally mandated job. You must continue to keep Texans and Americans safe and defend against a southern border invasion. I direct you to use all available resources and tools to deter illegal border crossings, to arrest and return illegal border crossers, and to arrest criminals who violate Texas law &quot;The governor wrote a letter.</p><p></span><br /></div>
