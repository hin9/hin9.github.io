				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>The Senate is set to pass landmark legislation this week to federally enshrine both same-sex and interracial marriage rights, amid Democratic concerns that the Supreme Court&apos;s conservative majority will overturn both protections.</p><p>The first key test vote to begin formal debate on the bill was held on Wednesday.</p><p>That procedural hurdle was overcome with a 62-37 vote, with 12 Republicans joining the 50-member Democratic caucus, putting the bill on track to pass as early as Thursday, if opponents agree to drop their opposition before lawmakers leave for the week-long Thanksgiving recess. Susan Collins of Maine, Rob Portman of Ohio, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Mitt Romney of Utah, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Dan Sullivan of Alaska, Roy Blunt of Missouri, Richard Burr of North Carolina, Joni Ernst of Iowa, Todd Young of Indiana, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska were the 12 Republicans who voted yes.</p><p>&quot;Individuals in same-sex and interracial marriages need and deserve the confidence and certainty that their marriages are legal and will remain legal,&quot; said Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisconsin, a bill co-sponsor and the first openly LGBTQ woman elected to Congress. &quot;These loving couples should have the same rights and liberties as any other marriage.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I know that passing the Respect for Marriage Act is as personal as it gets for many senators and their staffs, including myself,&quot; said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer this week. He mentioned that his married daughter and her wife are expecting a child in February.</p><p>Schumer has argued that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas&apos; concurring opinion this summer overturning Roe v. Wade, in which he said the court &quot;should reconsider&quot; the case granting the nationwide right to gay marriage, jeopardized the rights of LGBTQ Americans.</p><p>Other justices on the high court had gone out of their way to distance Thomas&apos; viewpoint from the majority opinion overturning Roe.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>According to a summary from the bill&apos;s sponsors, the Respect for Marriage Act would &quot;require the federal government to recognize a marriage between two individuals if the marriage was valid in the state where it was performed,&quot; including Congress&apos; first openly bisexual woman in the Senate, Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., as well as Susan Collins, R-Maine, Rob Portman, R-Ohio, and Thom Tillis, R-N.C.</p><p>The bill would not require any state to issue marriage licenses in violation of its laws, but it would require states to recognize legally granted marriages performed in other states, including same-sex and interracial unions.</p><p>It&apos;s about giving people &quot;security in their marriages,&quot; says Portman, whose son came out as gay several years ago.</p><p>&quot;It is critical to reassure people that they will not lose their rights as they move from state to state. It&apos;s a fairly straightforward bill &quot;Previously, he stated that the American people have evolved to support the issue, and Congress should do the same.</p><p>However, ahead of the vote on Wednesday, some Republicans called the legislation unnecessary.</p><p>&quot;I think it&apos;s pretty telling that Sen. Schumer puts a bill on the floor to reaffirm what is already a constitutional right of same-sex marriage, which is not under any imminent threat,&quot; said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, referring to the annual defense policy bill that has yet to be passed by the chamber this year.</p><p></span><br /></div>
