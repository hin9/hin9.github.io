				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet will soon transport players to the Paldea region, and despite the new Spain-inspired setting, one thing remains constant: version-exclusive Pokemon. Yes, there will once again be Pokemon in Scarlet that are not available in Violet, and vice versa. You&apos;ll need to trade with a friend if you want to collect them all.</p><p>Beginning with Pokemon Red and Blue in the late 1990s, each new generation has been divided into two distinct versions, each with its own set of Pokemon that can only be found when that version of the game is loaded. Pokemon Scarlet and Violet are no exception, and we&apos;ve already learned about some of the Pokemon species that will only be found in Scarlet or Violet.</p><p>A dozen Pokemon are currently available as version exclusives for this new generation, with six for Scarlet and six for Violet. Four of the 12 exclusive Pokemon announced so far are new to the Paldea region, including the legendaries Koraidon and Miraidon, and those new species are evenly split between Scarlet and Violet.</p><p>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet will be available exclusively on the Nintendo Switch on November 18. Check out our list of every Pokemon in Scarlet and Violet as well. You can also check out our complete Pokemon Scarlet and Violet review.</p><p>Koraidon is the Scarlet Legendary Pokemon. Despite having what appear to be tires along its chest, this Pokemon prefers to travel through Paldea on all fours with the player on its back.</p><p>Armarouge is a Fire and Psychic-type Pokemon that protects itself with the armor of a distinguished Paldean warrior. It can fire fireballs from its arms and use psychic energy stored in the suit to boost its abilities in battle.</p><p>This tiny Pokemon first appeared in Pokemon Gold and Silver&apos;s Johto region. According to its official Pokedex entry, it &quot;feeds on soil&quot; and &quot;falls asleep so it can grow after eating a large mountain.&quot;</p><p>Pupitar is Larvitar&apos;s first evolution, representing its &quot;pupa&quot; state before evolving into Tyranitar.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>Note: Pupitar has not been officially designated as a version exclusive, but because its pre-evolution Larvitar has been specified, its evolutions are assumed to be exclusive as well. Tyranitar is the second and final evolution of Larvitar, a massive Rock- and Dark-type Pokemon capable of causing earthquakes simply by walking around.</p><p>NOTE: Although Tyranitar has not been officially named as a version exclusive, because its pre-evolution Larvitar has been specified, its evolutions are assumed to be exclusive as well.</p><p>Stonjourer, the Big Rock Pokemon, debuted in the Galar region as a Rock-type Pokemon designed to represent Stonehenge (exclusively in Pokemon Sword). It walks on massive boulders, which it can also kick opponents with.</p><p>Miraidon is the polar opposite of Koraidon and the Legendary Pokemon of Pokemon Violet. Rather than traveling on all fours, Miraidon transforms into a motorcycle and rides the player through the Paldean region on its back. Ceruledge is a Pokemon of the Fire and Ghost types. Each arm&apos;s blades are made of a fire and ghost energy hybird and will transform into great swords during battle.</p><p>Bagon debuted as the &quot;Rock Head Pokemon&quot; in Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire&apos;s Hoenn region. When it evolves, it, like Larvitar, will form a cocoon around itself, followed by a second evolution.</p><p>Shelgon is Bagon&apos;s first evolution, representing its cocoon-like shelled state before evolving into Salamence again.</p><p></span><br /></div>
