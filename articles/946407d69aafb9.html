				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>A landmark settlement approved by a federal court will result in an estimated $6 billion in student loan forgiveness for over 200,000 borrowers.</p><p>The agreement reached between the Biden administration and a class of student loan borrowers to resolve claims of delayed or unprocessed loan forgiveness applications is one of the most comprehensive agreements to resolve disputed student debt to date. Borrowers&apos; victory follows recent legal setbacks in other, unrelated federal student loan forgiveness initiatives.</p><p>Sweet v. Cardona is a class-action lawsuit filed by student loan borrowers during the Trump administration that was recently settled. Borrowers claimed that the Education Department, led by former Secretary Besty DeVos, failed to process and approve thousands of applications for Borrower Defense to Repayment, or arbitrarily denied them.</p><p>Borrowers who can demonstrate that they were misled into enrolling or remaining enrolled at an institution due to misrepresentations or false promises about key aspects of their program are eligible for federal student loan cancellation under the Borrower Defense program. Misrepresentations about admissions criteria, the ability to transfer credits to other institutions, or job prospects are examples of this.</p><p>The lawsuit, as well as additional allegations made in court filings after the suit was filed, claimed that the Education Department had wrongfully delayed processing applications (leaving many borrowers in limbo for years) or issued blanket denials without adequate review. Following the 2020 election, the lawsuit against the Biden administration was continued.</p><p>Over 200,000 federal student loan borrowers who submitted Borrower Defense applications by June 22, 2022 and attended an approved list of dozens of individual schools will be approved for student loan forgiveness under the terms of the approved settlement agreement. According to an FAQ page set up by the Project on Predatory Student Lending, one of the organizations representing the class of borrowers, &quot;within one year of the effective date of the settlement agreement, these class members will have their outstanding loans relating to these schools fully discharged and will receive refunds of any amounts they previously paid the federal government toward those loans.&quot; Borrowers&apos; damaged credit will also be repaired.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>An additional 64,000 borrowers who borrowed to attend schools that are not on the approved list but whose Borrower Defense applications were delayed by the Education Department will have their applications reviewed within rolling deadlines based on how long their application has been pending. If the Department fails to meet any of the deadlines specified in the approved settlement agreement, these borrowers will receive full settlement relief.</p><p>Furthermore, between December 2019 and October 2020, the Department of Education will rescind all Borrower Defense denials issued.</p><p>Borrowers who applied for Borrower Defense between June 22, 2022 and November 16, 2022 (when the settlement was approved) will be considered post-class applicants and may still be eligible for some settlement benefits. According to the FAQ page, &quot;Post-Class Applicants will receive decisions on their applications within 36 months of the settlement&apos;s final approval date.&quot; &quot;If the Department does not provide a decision within that time period, [borrowers] will receive the same relief as if they were a class member in the decision group who did not receive a timely decision (loan discharge, refund, and credit repair).&quot;</p><p>&quot;This is a life-changing and long-awaited victory for our clients who have fought tirelessly in this case,&quot; said Eileen Connor, president and director of the Project on Predatory Student Lending.</p><p></span><br /></div>
