				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>The much-awaited next generation of Pokmon is nearly here. Pokmon Scarlet and Violet will be available in less than 24 hours, and players are eager to get their hands on them. Many people are looking for a midnight release event in order to get a physical copy as soon as it becomes available, while others are looking for leaks online. Is there a way to start playing the game earlier? This is how.</p><p>If you did not receive an advance copy of the game as a reviewer or influencer, you should not be able to get your hands on it until it is officially released. Having said that, different release dates apply depending on your location. The game will be available in the United States at 12 a.m. EST on November 18, but it will also be available to west coast players starting at 9 p.m. PST on November 17.</p><p>If you live in the United Kingdom, you can play the game up to five hours earlier than Americans, with the title becoming available at 12 a.m. GMT on November 18.</p><p>The game will generally be available at midnight in your region on November 18, though neither Nintendo nor GameFreak have officially confirmed the launch times.</p><p>Though there are numerous videos and source codes available online that will grant you early access to Pokmon Scarlet and Violet, none of them are particularly legal to obtain. The only way to play the game &quot;early&quot; is to register your Switch in a time zone that has access to the game before yours.</p><p>However, simply putting your Switch in a specific time zone will not grant you early access to the game. You must purchase the game through that region&apos;s Switch store, which means you cannot have already placed your preorder for the game.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>You must also ensure that your payment method is registered in that region. While you do not need an international bank account to do so, you must add funds to your regional eShop profile before purchasing the game to gain early access.</p><p>Even so, this is not a guaranteed method. If you want to know more about the game before it comes out, there are plenty of leaks available online that will walk you through it. If you still can&apos;t decide which version of the game to get, the entire PokDex has already been leaked, as have the version exclusives.</p><p>At GameStop, you may be able to celebrate the midnight release of &apos;Pokmon Scarlet&apos; and &apos;Violet.&apos;</p><p>What Is the Difference Between Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet?
