				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>For many years, the Subaru Impreza has served as the foundation for more interesting vehicles. The WRX was first, followed by the Crosstrek. While the WRX has separated from the Impreza to become its own entity, the Crosstrek remains a lifted Impreza hatchback and a go-to option for those looking for go-anywhere capability in a smaller, more economical package.</p><p>The 2024 Subaru Impreza is an entirely new model, and while that will undoubtedly have ramifications for the future Crosstrek, Subaru has gone to greater lengths this time to ensure that the Impreza is more than just a naked, lowered Crosstrek. In terms of philosophy, this means it&apos;ll be sportier, distinguishing itself from its off-roader sibling. There are only three trim levels now, and the top two, Sport and RS, err on the athletic side with a sport-tuned suspension, larger wheels, Subaru&apos;s SI-Drive performance management system (basically a sport mode for the engine and transmission), and sportier styling cues than both the base model and what you might have expected from stock Imprezas in the past.</p><p>And, as previously stated, the Impreza RS returns to the lineup after nearly two decades on the sidelines, having been effectively replaced as the sportiest Impreza in North America by the WRX. Mechanically, it is identical to the Impreza Sport trim with one important exception: the engine. The base and Sport models get a 2.0-liter boxer-four with 152 horsepower and 145 pound-feet of torque, while the RS gets a tweaked version of the current Crosstrek&apos;s engine upgrade. The 2.5-liter boxer-four produces 182 hp and 178 lb-ft of torque, a 2 lb-ft increase that comes on 700 rpm earlier. Every Impreza comes standard with all-wheel drive (surprise!) and a continuously variable transmission, which allows the driver to choose between eight pre-set ratios with shift paddles in the Sport and RS.</p><p>The RS (shown in red above) has gloss black exterior trim and upgraded headlights, as well as gunmetal interior trim, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, alloy pedals, blind-spot warning, and heated sport seats covered in black cloth with red cloth bolsters. The RS comes standard with a sunroof, power driver seat, and a 10-speaker Harman Kardon sound system.</p></span><br /></div>

				<br />			
				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>Unfortunately, the RS will no longer be available as a coupe, nor will it be available as a sedan, as every 2024 Subaru Impreza is a four-door hatchback. Interestingly, the current-generation Impreza&apos;s sedan/hatchback take rate was 50/50, and Subaru claims that if the company had unlimited resources, it would have built a sedan. However, it does not, and given the continued decline in sedan popularity, that take rate would not have lasted long. Besides, when you consider the Crosstrek, the needle is already skewed in favor of the hatchback.</p><p>Other significant improvements for the all-new Impreza include a 10% stiffer construction due to additional structural adhesives that also reduce weight. Subaru claims that the front seats were designed for greater comfort, and that efforts were made to reduce particularly unpleasant sound frequencies in the cabin (removing the CVT would have probably helped on that front, but we digress).</p><p></span><br /></div>
