				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Thursday that she will not run for reelection to her congressional leadership position, ending a two-decade run as the top House Democrat that saw her become the chamber&apos;s first female leader.</p><p>Pelosi stated on the House floor that she will remain a member of Congress and complete the term to which she was recently elected.</p><p>&quot;With great confidence in our caucus, I will not seek reelection to Democratic leadership in the next Congress,&quot; Pelosi said during the 14-minute speech, which was interrupted by rounds of applause.</p><p>&quot;The time has come for a new generation to lead the Democratic Congress, which I deeply respect,&quot; Pelosi said. &quot;And I am grateful that so many people are ready and willing to take on this enormous responsibility.&quot;</p><p>The announcement came a day after news outlets predicted that Democrats would lose their House majority to Republicans in the aftermath of the midterm elections.</p><p>Pelosi, 82, has kept her future plans under wraps in the aftermath of the midterm elections, in which Democrats outperformed expectations across the board. Republicans, who expected a &quot;red wave&quot; to deliver them sweeping majorities in Congress, will instead take a razor-thin lead in the House, according to NBC News.</p><p>Pelosi has also stated that a recent hammer-wielding home intruder attack on her husband, Paul Pelosi, would influence her decision to remain in leadership.</p><p>Current House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., is widely regarded as the leading candidate to become Speaker of the House in the next Congress. McCarthy won a party vote on Tuesday to become the Republican nominee for speaker, though he received fewer votes than the 218 he will need when the full House votes on leadership in early January.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>Much is unknown about how the change in House leadership will affect Democrats&apos; top ranks. Majority in the House Steny Hoyer, D-Md., has worked for Pelosi for years, but the 83-year-old announced later Thursday that he, too, will decline to run for the top job.</p><p>In a letter distributed by his office, Hoyer stated, &quot;I have decided not to seek elected leadership in the 118th Congress.&quot; Hoyer, like Pelosi, stated his intention to remain in Congress and &quot;return to the Appropriations Committee as a member to complete work in which I have been involved for many years.&quot;</p><p>Meanwhile, Democrats are seeking younger leaders to usher in a new era of leadership. In the letter, Hoyer endorsed New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, 52, for the position of Democratic House leader. &quot;He is a skilled and capable leader who will help us reclaim the majority in 2024 as we strive to keep our promises to the American people,&quot; Hoyer wrote.</p><p>House Majority Whip James Clyburn, an influential veteran Democrat from South Carolina, backed Jeffries for Democratic leadership, as did Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark and California Rep. Pete Aguilar.</p><p>Pelosi was elected to Congress in 1987 and became the highest-ranking woman in congressional history in 2002, when she was elected House minority whip following that year&apos;s midterm elections. She was elected House Minority Leader in 2003 and Speaker of the House after Democrats reclaimed the majority in 2006.</p><p>Pelosi presided over a slew of major political milestones and crises during her two terms as speaker, including two impeachment proceedings against then-President Donald Trump. She navigated Congress through the 2008 financial crisis, the contentious battle to pass the Affordable Care Act, and efforts to approve trillions of dollars in coronavirus relief funds.</p><p></span><br /></div>
