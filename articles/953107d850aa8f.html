				</div>
				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>Speaker Nancy Pelosi&apos;s tenure as leader of the House Democratic Party is coming to an end, and she is handing the baton to a new generation of leaders.</p><p>Why it is significant: Those who have stood by her side for nearly two decades, including Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Whip Jim Clyburn, have said they are willing to step aside to allow the new guard to take power. Reps. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), Katherine Clark (D-MA), and Pete Aguilar (D-CA) have risen as a result.</p><p>What&apos;s making headlines: Pelosi announced Thursday afternoon on the House floor, in an emotional and historic speech, that she will not run for leadership again, but that she will remain a member of the House.</p><p>Steny Hoyer, an 83-year-old Maryland Democrat, has been coy for months about whether he would try to replace Pelosi as leader if she stepped down. But, like Pelosi, he announced on Thursday that he does not intend to seek another leadership position.</p><p>It is worth noting that other members may make their own bid to replace Pelosi, though this is unlikely. No one else has stepped forward to challenge Jeffries for the role as of yet.</p><p>Get to know the potential new leaders listed below.</p><p>The 52-year-old New Yorker is the fifth-ranking Democrat in Congress, representing parts of Brooklyn and Queens. Jeffries has long been considered the frontrunner to succeed Pelosi and is widely expected to do so.</p><p>What to watch: Jeffries and Pelosi are close, but Jeffries hasn&apos;t developed a strong relationship with his party&apos;s left wing. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) had previously considered running a primary challenge against Jeffries in the 2020 election cycle.</p><p>As Assistant Speaker, the 59-year-old has become a popular member of the caucus, assisting new members in settling into their new jobs.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>The Democratic Caucus Vice Chair, 43, is the highest-ranking Hispanic in Congress.</p><p>Editor&apos;s note: This story has been updated to include more information.</p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi&apos;s (D-Calif.) private deliberations on running for minority leader have temporarily halted a potentially ugly fight that could reveal the party&apos;s ideological and generational divides.</p><p>Making headlines: Pelosi&apos;s longtime deputy, Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md. ), is keeping his options open regardless of Pelosi&apos;s decision, according to Axios. If Pelosi leaves but Hoyer remains in charge, it will be a game of musical chairs, with only three leadership seats for four lawmakers.</p><p>According to her spokesperson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) will announce her &quot;future plans&quot; to House Democratic colleagues on Thursday.</p><p>Making headlines: Republicans were given control of the House in the 2022 elections on Wednesday.</p><p>Conservatives both inside and outside of Congress are engaged in a coordinated effort to pressure House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to postpone GOP leadership elections.</p><p>Why it&apos;s important: Conservatives are attempting to consolidate power within the party following an unexpectedly weak midterm performance in which Democrats retained control of the Senate and House Republicans are on track for a razor-thin majority.</p><p></span><br /></div>
