				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>How hot is the water in Lake Erie? Cold air must travel above relatively warm surface water for lake-effect snow to occur, and surface water temperatures at Lake Erie have hovered in the mid- to low-fifties from the end of October to the present, according to NOAA data. While this is far from the high-70s that surface water temperatures can reach in the summer, the mid-November average is closer to the mid- to high-40s. &quot;Lake Erie and Lake Ontario surface water temperatures are about 5 degrees above normal for this time of year,&quot; AccuWeather Senior Weather Editor and meteorologist Jesse Ferrell said. For lake-effect snow to form, meteorologists typically look for a temperature difference of 23 degrees Fahrenheit or greater between the lake water and the air about 5,000 feet above the lake&apos;s surface.</p><p>As the lake-effect snow-boosted storm began Thursday night in Erie County, New York, power outages began to spread. According to PowerOutage.US, over 2,000 customers in Erie County were without power as of 9:20 p.m. EST. Due to the snowstorm, the county was declared in an emergency and a county-wide travel ban was imposed. During a snowstorm, power outages can occur due to heavy snow weighing down power lines or motor vehicle accidents crashing into poles.</p><p>Due to the &quot;imminent storm,&quot; Erie County in western New York has declared a state of emergency and imposed a travel ban throughout the county. Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz stated that the driving ban would go into effect at 9 p.m. and would be reviewed on Friday morning. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul declared a disaster emergency for multiple counties, including Erie, on Wednesday, which went into effect Thursday morning. With this disaster declaration, the governor also declared that the New York State Thruway would be closed to commercial traffic from Rochester Exit 46 to the Pennsylvania border at Exit 61.</p><p>Buffalo and its surrounding towns are bracing for a potentially historic lake-effect snow event, but why is the snow concentrating in this part of New York? The answer has to do with the wind direction matching the shape of Lake Erie. The term fetch refers to how long the wind blows over a body of water; the higher the fetch, the more the atmosphere interacts with the body of water. A higher fetch produces a well-defined, persistent band of heavy snow in the case of lake-effect snow.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>The wind is expected to blow from the southwest across Lake Erie&apos;s entire 240-mile length into the weekend. This puts Buffalo and the surrounding towns directly in the path of the developing lake-effect snow bands. The wind will also cause water to accumulate on the lake&apos;s northeastern shores, causing coastal flooding along the lake&apos;s immediate shore.</p><p>Buffalo, New York, Mayor Byron Brown issued a warning Friday afternoon that, while city resources are being mobilized to clear the roads, residents should avoid unnecessary travel until Saturday. &quot;Visibility will be extremely difficult, and people must exercise patience,&quot; Brown told AccuWeather National Reporter Jillian Angeline. &quot;This isn&apos;t going to be your typical Buffalo snowfall. This will be a powerful storm.&quot; Throughout the storm, up to 100 plow trucks will be on standby, and GPS on the vehicles will allow the public to track the plows and where they&apos;ve been.</p><p></span><br /></div>
