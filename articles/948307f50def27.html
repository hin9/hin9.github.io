				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>The Subaru Impreza enters its sixth generation with a slimmed-down lineup that shifts its focus, dropping the Premium and Limited models and adding a new more powerful RS trim that sits alongside the base model and the Sport. The RS gets the 182-hp 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine found in the Crosstrek, which gives it 30 more horsepower and 33 more pound-feet of torque than the other Impreza models.</p><p>The styling of the 2024 Impreza updates the same familiar design. The grille is taller and the chrome trim has been replaced with a more subdued black piece. More pronounced rear wheel arches give the vehicle a sportier appearance. Also at the rear, the taillights have been updated with a new design that protrudes less into the rear hatch. The RS model is also distinguished by an RS badge.</p><p>When the third-generation WRX debuted last year, Subaru announced that it would only be available as a sedan. The company has now decided to make the sixth-generation Impreza a hatchback only, further distinguishing the two models. It&apos;s a logical move; according to a spokesperson for Subaru, the hatchback will account for 73% of Impreza sales in 2022.</p><p>Subaru has updated its EyeSight driver-assist technology for the Impreza so that it recognizes cyclists and pedestrians faster and has a wider field of view. The new Impreza attempts to provide more comfort by reducing cabin noise and providing more supportive front seats. Subaru is bringing the Impreza&apos;s 11.6-inch vertical center screen, bringing it in line with the rest of the lineup. Previously, the Impreza&apos;s largest infotainment screen was 8.0 inches.</p><p>The same 2.0-liter horizontally opposed four-cylinder engine produces 152 horsepower and 145 pound-feet of torque in the Base and Sport trim levels. Subaru is discontinuing the five-speed manual transmission in favor of the CVT. Normally, we&apos;d lament the loss of a manual transmission, but the five-speed was so inaccurate that it won&apos;t be missed. The Sport and RS trims will get paddle shifters as well as a simulated &quot;manual mode&quot; with eight preset ratios. All-wheel drive is standard, and a new active torque vectoring system has been added. The 2024 Impreza also gets a version of the WRX&apos;s dual-pinion electronic steering rack, which should improve steering feel, and Subaru claims the car has 10% more structural rigidity thanks to a redesigned, lighter inner frame.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>Subaru&apos;s return of the RS badge and the Crosstrek&apos;s 182-hp 2.5-liter engine to the Impreza is a welcome move. In our testing, that engine accelerated the Crosstrek to 60 mph in 7.5 seconds, while the Impreza&apos;s 152-hp 2.0-liter engine takes just under nine seconds.</p><p>Aside from increased power, the RS receives some styling changes to help differentiate it from the lower trims. The front doors and rear hatch have RS badging. The RS replaces the body-color side mirrors and rocker panel molding with black ones. The interior features simulated carbon and gunmetal trim. The front seats are upholstered in black cloth with red bolstering, while the steering wheel and shifter are upholstered in leather. The RS logo appears on the carpeted floor mats.</p><p>It&apos;s still no thrill-seeking hot hatch, but Subaru has added a little pep to its step. Subaru hasn&apos;t released pricing information yet, but the 2023 model starts at $20,815 and we expect the newer vehicle to cost slightly more.</p><p></span><br /></div>
