				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>On November 17, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi delivers remarks from the Capitol&apos;s House chamber.</p><p>Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who broke the &quot;marble ceiling&quot; to become the first woman to lead the United States House, announced on Thursday that she will step down as party leader.</p><p>&quot;I will not run for Democratic leadership in the next Congress because I am confident in our caucus. For me, the time has come for a new generation to lead the Democratic caucus, which I greatly admire &quot;Pelosi stated this during a speech on the House floor. &quot;I&apos;m grateful that so many people are ready and willing to take on this enormous responsibility.&quot;</p><p>Pelosi stated that she will remain in the House to represent her San Francisco district.</p><p>Pelosi warned in her remarks that democracy is &quot;majestic, but fragile,&quot; and that voters in 2022 sent a message to Congress that they would not support those who supported violence or insurgency. She also praised the chamber for becoming more diverse during her 35-year tenure. There were 12 women in the Democratic caucus when she first entered Congress in 1987; now there are 90. &quot;And we want more,&quot; she applauded.</p><p>Her decision comes a day after Republicans officially took control of the chamber in the 2022 midterm elections, and three weeks after her husband, Paul, was violently assaulted at their San Francisco home.</p><p>After the &quot;red wave&quot; failed to materialize on Election Day, the GOP is expected to have a razor-thin majority. Democrats defied historical expectations by outperforming expectations in governor, Senate, and House elections.</p></span><br /></div>

				<div class="write-up"><span style="font-weight:normal; font-size:18px"><p>Her decision comes as no surprise on Capitol Hill, and it is consistent with a promise she made four years ago to self-term limit after Democrats won the majority in 2018 and she became the first speaker to claim the speakership twice since the legendary Sam Rayburn. There has been a quiet desire among rank-and-file Democrats to elect a younger slate of leaders to replace Pelosi, who is 82, and the two other top House Democratic leaders, Reps. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., and Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., both of whom are in their 80s.</p><p>Following Pelosi&apos;s announcement, Hoyer, the current House Majority Leader, announced that he will not run for leadership in the next Congress.</p><p>&quot;Now is the time for a new generation of leaders,&quot; Hoyer said in a statement, adding that he would support Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jefferies in his bid for the presidency.</p><p>House Democrats will hold leadership elections at the end of the month, and Pelosi&apos;s announcement is expected to spark a rush of leadership bids.</p><p>Jeffries of New York, Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, and Pete Aguilar of California are at the top of the list. All three are currently in lower-level leadership positions and want to advance. Jeffries, Clark, and Aguilar, all 52, would make an African American, a white woman, and a Hispanic the party&apos;s new faces. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) is also considering a leadership run.</p><p>Even those who have previously disagreed with Pelosi praise her record of steering her often divided caucus through difficult times with little room for error.</p><p></span><br /></div>
